repeat 100 times:
    1. randomly generate a tree
    2. simulate data on the tree
    3. calculate support for the original tree based on the data
       -> store these values
   
    repeat 100 times:
        4. randomize the tree
        5. calculate support for the random tree based on the data
            -> store these values, grouped by whether or not the randomized branch in question was present in the original tree

present:
1. distribution of values from original trees
2. distribution of values from original branches from random trees VS random branches from original trees 


plot: branch *depth* by support value, for original branches in original trees, for taxon jackknife ica, bootstrap ica, bayes ica.
